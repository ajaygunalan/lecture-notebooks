## Current Research Challenges

- Dealing with contact (legged locomotion, manipulation, etc.)
- Dealing with high-dimensional systems (e.g. deformable objects)
- Bridging the gap between model-based control and RL
- Safety guarantees for uncertain nonlinear systems
- Dealing with other (possibly adversarial) agents

## What Are We Doing Here?

- Optimization-based control techniques
- Focus on robotics applications over theory
- Homeworks (~4) focused on algorithm implementation
- Course project in groups of 1-5 (do something cool!)

---

## Logistics

- Lectures in person + zoom – will be recorded and posted
- Notes from lectures will be posted
- Piazza for course communication
- Homework will be distributed on GitHub and turned in through Gradescope
- Office hours TBD
